Don't Press The Red Button!

Of course you're going to press it, aren't you?

Almost everyone has heard about the Don't Press the Red Button game and there are like a 
kajillion varaitions that are made of it

So I thought,

'Why don't I just make a variation of my very own as well?'

It might not be good like other versions, but I tried my best to make it interactive

Enjoy!

By the way, you can edit the code but I won't accept pull requests
